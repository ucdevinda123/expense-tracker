# How To set up
Make sure to install expo-cli in your pc 
 `yarn add expo`     - Recomended to use yarn as sometimes installation via npm might be broken 
 or if you don't want to use yarn use (Might have issues with latest expo-cli)
`npm install -g expo-cli` 

if all good on the root folder of the project run

`npm start`

Once everything set up browser will show expo console with a QR code.

if you want to run in a physical device just go ahead and install expo app  then scan the QR code (make sure to use same WLAN)
